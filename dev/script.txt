***DUALITY***


Base game “there will be filler to make the story longer”
not included here

Duality Chapter 1 “Rhetorical Soul”

You wake up in a strange room filled with alien like creatures "Fin's"
which all tell you to gain true flesh
they guide you to a pedestal
in which a giant purple hand offers to give you life in exchange for your soul
which your only option is to accept

once you do that
Steven "you" wakes up in his bedroom on a Thursday at noon "exactly 12:00 – symbolic"
you change out of your pajamas then to hear your mom singing and the smell of pancakes
your brother Johnny is watching TV in the living room begging to not be bothered
you have the option to skip or eat breakfast “choice matters”
your sister is playing outside and you see her looking into the bushes
“for a split second you see the same “Fin” alien that was from before
before it goes back into the bushes
then your sister sees you and tells you the bus is late
you both wait on the bench outside your house
until the bus arrives

Duality Chapter 2 “School House Rock”

On the bus you have the option to talk to Luke – Marty – Evan
as follows
-----------------------------------------
Evan asks about your day
then starts rambling about politics
-----------------------------------------
Luke asks about your family
then starts asking if you have a girlfriend yet
-----------------------------------------
Marty asks if life really matters
then it devolves into a different topic

after talking to all three

Amber “Bully” gets on the bus
she threatens to
“Beat the shit out of you if you don’t move over”
“this choice matters”
not doing anything causes her to get mad
and slam your head into the ground
and walk over you to the back of the bus

moving over does nothing
and progresses the game

once you get to school

Ms. Ferrethall
your teacher “depending on the outcome of bus choice”
will send you to the nurse first
or progress the game with the nonviolent bus choice

“nurse will patch you up and send you back”

at school in the classroom
you have the option to
Sleep
or Learn

Sleeping

Will put you in a dream with those “Fin” creatures
instead they are all deformed and melting around you
until you wake up to realize Amber put a bag over your head
without the teacher noticing

Learning

Short montage of you listening to the teacher
and writing down your work



Afterwards, the bell rings
and you go to the lockers
and get your stuff

then go to your sisters classroom and pick her up

then you leave the school for the day
waiting for the bus
